        <img src="side.jpg" alt="Side effects" class="book-image">
        <p class="book-description">"Side Effects," directed by Steven Soderbergh, is a psychological thriller that 
            delves into the complexities of mental health, medication, and the ethical dilemmas faced in the medical 
            profession. Released in 2013, the film stars Rooney Mara as Emily Taylor, a woman struggling with severe 
            anxiety and depression following her husband's release from prison. In her quest for relief, she begins taking 
            a new antidepressant prescribed by her psychiatrist, Dr. Jonathan Banks, played by Jude Law.
            As the story unfolds, the film explores the consequences of pharmaceutical dependence and the dark side of 
            mental health treatment. With unexpected twists and a gripping narrative, "Side Effects" raises important 
            questions about the intersection of mental illness, medication, and morality. Soderbergh's direction, combined 
            with strong performances from the cast, creates a tense atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their 
            seats, ultimately leading to a shocking conclusion that challenges perceptions of trust and betrayal in both 
            personal and professional relationships </p>

        <img src="dollars.jpeg" alt="A fistful of dollars" class="book-image">
        <p class="book-description">"A Fistful of Dollars," directed by Sergio Leone and released in 1964, is a seminal 
            Spaghetti Western that redefined the genre and introduced audiences to the iconic character of the "Man with 
            No Name," portrayed by Clint Eastwood. This film marked the beginning of what would become known as the 
            "Dollars Trilogy," a series that would solidify Eastwood's status as a cinematic legend.
            Set in a desolate border town, the story follows a mysterious gunslinger who arrives in the midst of a violent 
            conflict between two rival families. As he navigates the treacherous landscape of greed and betrayal, the 
            gunslinger uses his cunning and sharpshooting skills to manipulate both sides for his own gain. The film is 
            characterized by its striking cinematography, memorable score by Ennio Morricone, and Leone's signature style 
            of storytelling, which blends tension and dark humor.
            "A Fistful of Dollars" not only revitalized the Western genre but also influenced countless filmmakers and 
            spawned a new wave of Italian cinema. With its themes of moral ambiguity and survival, the film remains a 
            classic, showcasing the gritty realism and complex characters that have come to define the Spaghetti Western 
            tradition.</p>

        <p class="book-description">"Heat," directed by Michael Mann and released in 1995, is a renowned crime thriller 
            that explores the intense cat-and-mouse game between professional bank robber Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) 
            and LAPD detective Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino). Set in Los Angeles, the film delves into their personal struggles
             and moral dilemmas, showcasing the complexities of both sides of the law.
            The movie is celebrated for its meticulous attention to detail, particularly in its iconic action sequences, 
            including a memorable downtown shootout. Mann's use of lighting, sound design, and a haunting score enhances 
            the film's tense atmosphere. "Heat" stands out as a modern classic, examining themes of loyalty and ambition 
            while featuring powerful performances from its lead actors.</p>

            crime film that delves into the dark underbelly of 1950s Los Angeles. Based on James Ellroy's novel of the
